# Ether Ore

## Description
**Ether Ore** is a **VR game** made in **Unreal Engine 4** that offers a unique asymmetric multiplayer experience. One player wears a **VR headset**, while additional players view a shared screen. The game was created as a short **demo for a game jam**, exploring the idea of **perception manipulation** between the VR player and the spectators.

The setting is a **simulated testing grounds**, where **rocks have been converted into an aerosol** to study their effects on humans. These effects **alter the VR player’s perception**, creating challenges that require cooperation with the non-VR players.  

One example includes inducing **color blindness** in the VR player, requiring them to rely on others to identify the correct button to press.  

The game is built using **Unreal Blueprints** and is available as a **project file** to be run directly in Unreal Engine 4.
